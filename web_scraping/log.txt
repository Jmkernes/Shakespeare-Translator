**** Manual Error report ****
Downloading henry4pt2 will fail. To fix this, you must start counting page numbers at 254 (i.e. the end of henry4pt1) instead of the default page_0

Downloading the sonnets will also fail. These are longer texts and are numbered via the /sonnets_##/ as opposed to /page_##/. Making that fix in the source code will patch this.

In all files, there are two errors the code fails to catch for some reason (there is cell mismatch between original and modern, yet somehow the lengths end up the same?). These occur in line 1121 of richardiii and 830 of romeojulie with the strings "this found i on my tent this morning" and "(to ROMEO) Stop your evil work, vile Montague!..." I fixed these entries by hand
